# Productivity Buddy Timer
This repository contains a custom built Productivity Timer application built using Python and tkinter for the GUI.

This application offers the opportunity to enhance productivity, complying with Pomodoro study method, consisting of 25 minute study intervals. The timer will automatically reset at 0 seconds and return to its initial state (25 minutes). In the meantime, it could be paused or reset.

I am using Microsoft's focus sessions every day for study purposes and it is useful. It lacks a weekly history though and it does not directly connect with Microsoft To Do which would have been a very good feature. 

I will continue this app, adding some more features. The first feature I want to add is a daily reset which will occur every day at 00:00. The daily logs should also reset at the same time. Breaks and time period control directly through GUI will be added as well. The final goal is to make it possible to keep a weekly file log. Achieving this means that daily use of To Do will not be necessary. However, once a week, the Productivity Timer's results will have to be manually passed to To Do for better monitoring the study progress and applying improvements or better weekly time management. This is because To Do can keep log files for great periods of time.

Thank you!

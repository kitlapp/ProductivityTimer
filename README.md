# Productivity Buddy Timer
This repository contains a custom built Productivity Timer application built using Python and tkinter for the GUI.

This application offers the opportunity to enhance productivity, complying with Pomodoro study method, consisting of 25 minute study intervals. The timer will automatically reset at 0 seconds and return to its initial state (25 minutes). In the meantime, it could be paused or reset. The reset button always leads to the default 25 minute duration. The initial duration can be changed directly through the GUI. The initial duration's range is between 10 and 60 minutes. 

I am using Microsoft's focus sessions every day for study purposes and it is useful. It lacks a weekly history though and it does not directly connect with Microsoft To Do which would have been a very good feature. I will not add automatic 5 minute brakes to this app, although it seems to be a standard procedure. I do not use this feature in Microsoft's focus sessions either, as I am manually controling my brakes either with the app's pause button or by just letting the timer run out of time. In this app, brakes can be controlled with more options than in Microsoft's focus sessions because there is a reset choice as well. So, I think 5 minute brakes should not be a priority, as the method and the app can work like a charm without the need for automatic brakes.

I will continue this app, adding some more features. The first feature I want to add is a daily reset which will occur every day at 00:00. The daily logs should also reset at the same time. The final goal is to make it possible to keep a weekly file log. Achieving this means that daily use of To Do will not be necessary. However, once a week, the Productivity Timer's results will have to be manually passed to To Do for better monitoring the study progress and applying improvements or better weekly time management. This is because To Do can keep log files for great periods of time.

Thank you!
